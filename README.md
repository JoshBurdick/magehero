MageDevs
========

MageDevs is a curated listing of Magento developers.  

### Why?

Beacuse I'm always getting asked whether I know any good Magento developers that are available, 
and I figure something like this might help to reduce some of the friction in the finding/hiring
process.

### How do I get listed as a developer?

Submit a pull request, adding yourself into the developers.json

### Why is this hosted at magemail.co?

Because that was the quickest way for me to throw this up initially.
If someone would like to donate some hosting and a domain name,
would be happy to move it there.

### Why is the design of the site so horrendous?

Because I wanted to get something quick and dirty up to get the ball
rolling.  Building the database is really the most important
component of this.

If you're a designer and you'd like to put a nice face on this,
let us know.  Would be happy to feature you in the listing somehow
as a thanks for your services.
