MageHero
========

MageHero is a list of Magento developers.  The idea is for the community
to curate a list of quality Magento developers - to  make it easier for
people to find the good ones.

### Frequently asked questions
#### Why build this?

Beacuse I'm always getting asked whether I know any good Magento developers that are available, 
and I figure something like this might help to reduce some of the friction in the finding/hiring
process.

#### How does upvoting work?

Upvote other good developers.   This will help to create a list 
of developers that merchants and agencies can trust.

You can only upvote other developers if you are logged in and
if you have already received at least two upvotes.

#### Bro, this upvoting system sucks.  What gives bro?

I wrote a [post](https://mageunity.com/t/magehero-ranking/134) here explaining some of my thoughts around the
upvoting system - please feel free to comment there:

#### How do I get listed as a developer?

Just login and it will allow you to auth with GitHub and then click
on your username in the top right and save your details as JSON.

#### Why is the design of the site so horrendous?

Because I wanted to get something quick and dirty up to get the ball
rolling.  Building the database is really the most important
component of this.

If you're a designer and you'd like to put a nice face on this,
let us know.  Would be happy to feature you in the listing somehow
as a thanks for your services.

#### Why are profile details being managed as JSON?

Because the schema will probably change a lot by the time it's 
all said and done and this makes it easy to keep it flexible
meanwhile.  

Not exactly a UX best practice, but hey you're developers, so you
should enjoy the occasional JSON editing.
