MageDevs
========

MageDevs is a curated listing of Magento developers.  

### Why?

Beacuse I'm always getting asked whether I know any good Magento developers that are available, 
and I figure something like this might help to reduce some of the friction in the finding/hiring
process.

### How do I get listed as a developer?

Submit a pull request, adding yourself into the developers.json
