MageDevs
========

MageDevs is a curated listing of Magento developers.  

### Frequently asked questions
#### Why build this?

Beacuse I'm always getting asked whether I know any good Magento developers that are available, 
and I figure something like this might help to reduce some of the friction in the finding/hiring
process.

#### How do I get listed as a developer?

Just login and it will allow you to auth with GitHub and then click
on your username in the top right and save your details as JSON.

#### I'd like to help moderate this

Awesome.  Shoot me an email or hit me on twitter (kalenjordan).

#### Why is this hosted at magemail.co?

Because that was the quickest way for me to throw this up initially.
If someone would like to donate some hosting and a domain name,
would be happy to move it there.

#### Why is the design of the site so horrendous?

Because I wanted to get something quick and dirty up to get the ball
rolling.  Building the database is really the most important
component of this.

If you're a designer and you'd like to put a nice face on this,
let us know.  Would be happy to feature you in the listing somehow
as a thanks for your services.

#### Why are profile details being managed as JSON?

Because the schema will probably change a lot by the time it's 
all said and done and this makes it easy to keep it flexible
meanwhile.  

Not exactly a UX best practice, but hey you're developers, so you
should enjoy the occasional JSON editing.
