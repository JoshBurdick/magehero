MageHero
========

MageHero is a list of Magento developers.  The idea is for the community
to curate a list of quality Magento developers - to  make it easier for
people to find the good ones.

### Frequently asked questions
#### Why build this?

Initially the idea behind building this was because I'm always getting asked whether
I know any good Magento developers that are available, and I wanted to have a good
resource to point people to.

After getting some initial traction, I'm realizing that the majority of the people
signing up are great Magento developers but they're not available or looking for 
contract work.  So at the moment I'm just thinking of it as a nice index of
Magento developers.

At some point, I'll want to figure out a way to surface up developers that are 
actually available for work, or perhaps give developers ways to list specific types
of consulting or projects that they're interested in.  

But for now, it's just a general listing of developers in the community.

#### How does upvoting work?

Upvote other good developers.   This will help to create a list 
of developers that merchants and agencies can trust.

You can only upvote other developers if you are logged in and
if you have already received at least four upvotes.

#### Bro, this upvoting system sucks.  What gives bro?

I wrote a [post](https://mageunity.com/t/magehero-ranking/134) here explaining some of my thoughts around the
upvoting system - please feel free to comment there:

#### I want to complain about something, can I tweet at you?

I'd rather you didn't.  I'm getting a lot of noise in my twitter stream
about this and it's hard to have a good dialogue about these things
in twitter.

I'd rather that you join in on some of the discussions in MageUnity
or post a well-reasoned question or suggestion as a GitHub issue.

And also keep in mind that if you're going to suggest something, you
should be willing to build it yourself, since this is open source.

#### How do I get listed as a developer?

Just login and it will allow you to auth with GitHub and then click
on your username in the top right and save your details as JSON.

#### Why is the design of the site so horrendous?

Because I wanted to get something quick and dirty up to get the ball
rolling.  Building the database is really the most important
component of this.

Antonela (https://twitter.com/holantonela) has volunteered to work on the design, because she is
awesome and amazing!  Here's a sneak peek mockup:

#### Why are profile details being managed as JSON?

Because the schema will probably change a lot by the time it's 
all said and done and this makes it easy to keep it flexible
meanwhile.  

Not exactly a UX best practice, but hey you're developers, so you
should enjoy the occasional JSON editing.

#### There's a bug, how should I report it?

Since the project is open source and since you're a PHP developer,
and since my time is super limited to resolve and fix bugs, please do
some initial investigation of the issue to try and resolve it.
