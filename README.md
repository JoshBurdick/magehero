MageDevs
========

MageDevs is a curated listing of Magento developers.  

### Frequently asked questions
#### Why build this?

Beacuse I'm always getting asked whether I know any good Magento developers that are available, 
and I figure something like this might help to reduce some of the friction in the finding/hiring
process.

#### How do I get listed as a developer?

Submit a pull request, adding yourself into the developers.json

#### I'd like to help moderate this

Awesome.  Shoot me an email or hit me on twitter (kalenjordan).

#### Why is this hosted at magemail.co?

Because that was the quickest way for me to throw this up initially.
If someone would like to donate some hosting and a domain name,
would be happy to move it there.

#### Why is the design of the site so horrendous?

Because I wanted to get something quick and dirty up to get the ball
rolling.  Building the database is really the most important
component of this.

If you're a designer and you'd like to put a nice face on this,
let us know.  Would be happy to feature you in the listing somehow
as a thanks for your services.

#### Why are you managing data via a json file instead of a proper database?

Because I don't have the time to do all that.  Using json / github
allows for self-management by developers along with a permissions / 
moderation workflow right out of the box.

At some point, yes we'd defintely want to put this whole thing
behind a database with a proper login and self-management, but
this is just a minimal first draft.

If you have the time to build out the full database-driven app,
that would be awesome.  Would be happy to give you some credit / 
featured listing in here if you could help out with that.
